// Paths for writing intermediate and final outputs:
// 	Note: a sub-directory will be made using the samplename field
// path for flat/dark corrected, stitched projections
projpath	/mnt/data/anatomix_mousebrain/
// path for final projections (flat/dark corrected, stitched, filtered, ring corrected)
projpath2	/mnt/data/anatomix_mousebrain/
// reco will go in a sub-directory samplename/reco/
recopath	/mnt/data/anatomix_mousebrain/

// Filtering
// options are "paganin", "gauss", or "none"
//	for pagainin, width is delta/beta and you have to supply photonenergy [keV] and detdist [mm]
//	for gauss, width is sigma in pixels
// 	Note: my version of pagnin filter has a different normalization (only shifts output values, no difference in shape) which leaves units on filtered projection as transmission -- so recos still have units 1/mm

// Output gray scale
//	We convert floating point recos to (signed) 16-bit integers using the given scaling [low,high]->[-2^15,2^15]
//	Best way to choose is running test recos
